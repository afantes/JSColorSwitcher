Explanation of the Project :
----------------------------
This project aims to create a color selector using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to allow the user to choose a color from the provided options and dynamically change the background color of the page accordingly. Furthermore, the last selected color is saved and restored on subsequent visits to the page.

Utility of the code :
---------------------
The utility of the code is to provide a color selector functionality to users, allowing them to choose a background color for a webpage. Here are some specific utilities of the code:

+ Interactive Color Selection: The code enables users to interactively select a color by clicking on the provided color options. This allows them to visually explore different color choices and see the immediate effect on the webpage's background.

+ Real-Time Background Color Change: When a user selects a color, the code dynamically changes the background color of the webpage in real-time. This provides immediate feedback to the user, allowing them to visualize how different colors affect the overall appearance of the page.

+ Persistence of Selected Color: The code uses local storage to store the selected color. This ensures that when a user reloads or revisits the page, the previously selected color is restored as the background color. This persistence feature enhances the user experience by maintaining their preferred color choice across sessions.

Overall, the code enhances the interactivity and customization options of a webpage by allowing users to choose and preview different background colors. It provides a seamless and visually appealing way to personalize the appearance of the page based on individual preferences.
